The Qtables are organized consistent with the paper, where the maximal value in each row represents the chosen action in each state.

In the 'trajectories' folders, the number in file name indicates the recorded time step, and the interval between steps is 0.5s.

In the trajectory files, each row is corresponding with a particle.

The meanings of data in 'partifieldxxxxxxx' is ordered as:
    particle position(3), particle orientation unit vector(3), particle velocity(3), flow velocity at particle position(3), flow gradient at particle position(9).
